This is the directory where logs and output from the OSG jobs will go,
as specified in the submit scripts in the top-level directory

*.err is the stderr of the job
*.out is the stdout of the job
*.log is Condor's log of the status of the job, when/where it is running, memory usage, etc.

The err/out files will only be transferred once the job is done,
while the log files are updated periodically while the jobs is running
